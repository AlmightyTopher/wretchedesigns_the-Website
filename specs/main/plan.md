## Summary
Complete authenticated admin dashboard for Wretched Designs e-commerce site featuring Google OAuth authentication, gallery image management, product/storefront management, and Stripe-ready payment infrastructure. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth.js, deployed to Cloudflare Pages with cyberpunk/techno-goth aesthetic.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 15.2.0
**Primary Dependencies**: NextAuth.js 4.24.11, Tailwind CSS 3.4.1, React 18.3.1, Stripe 18.2.0
**Storage**: JSON file persistence (gallery.json, products.json) with future database migration path
**Testing**: Vitest 3.1.4 with React Testing Library 16.3.0 and jsdom environment
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Pages (Edge Runtime) with Node.js compatibility
**Project Type**: web - Next.js App Router with API routes and React components
**Performance Goals**: <200ms admin page loads, real-time JSON updates, responsive UI
**Constraints**: File-based persistence limitation on Cloudflare Pages, OAuth domain restrictions
**Scale/Scope**: Single admin user (Topher@TopherTek.com), unlimited gallery/products, future multi-admin support

**Arguments Integration**: Tech stack and architecture choices documented from completed implementation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Status**: Template constitution not customized - using industry best practices
**Applied Principles**:
- ✅ **Authentication-First**: All admin routes protected with NextAuth.js
- ✅ **API Security**: Protected endpoints with session validation
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict types
- ✅ **Component Modularity**: Reusable React components with clear interfaces
- ✅ **Environment Security**: Sensitive data in environment variables only
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Tailwind CSS responsive design system

No constitutional violations detected in current implementation.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Next.js App Router with integrated frontend/backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All technical decisions made and implemented

Key research findings documented in implementation:

1. **Authentication Provider Choice**: NextAuth.js selected over custom OAuth
   - Decision: NextAuth.js with Google provider
   - Rationale: Industry standard, handles OAuth flow complexity, session management
   - Alternatives considered: Custom implementation, Auth0, Clerk

2. **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
   - Decision: Next.js App Router with TypeScript
   - Rationale: Full-stack React framework, API routes, SSR/SSG, excellent TypeScript support
   - Alternatives considered: Vite+React, Remix, SvelteKit

3. **Styling Solution**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme
   - Decision: Tailwind CSS with custom color palette
   - Rationale: Utility-first, responsive design, custom theme support, existing site consistency
   - Alternatives considered: Styled-components, CSS modules, Emotion

4. **Data Persistence**: JSON files with database migration path
   - Decision: File-based JSON storage with future database migration
   - Rationale: Simple deployment, no database overhead, easy migration path
   - Alternatives considered: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cloudflare D1

5. **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration (scaffolded)
   - Decision: Stripe Checkout with disabled state until configured
   - Rationale: Industry standard, comprehensive feature set, developer-friendly
   - Alternatives considered: PayPal, Square, custom payment processing

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented and implemented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Design Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All contracts and models implemented

1. **Data Model Implementation** → `data-model.md`:
   - Gallery Image entity with metadata
   - Product entity with pricing and inventory
   - User session management via NextAuth

2. **API Contracts Generated** from functional requirements:
   - REST API endpoints for gallery and products
   - OpenAPI-compatible request/response schemas
   - Authentication middleware for protected routes

3. **Contract Tests Implementation**:
   - API route handlers with TypeScript validation
   - Authentication guards on all write operations
   - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Integration Test Scenarios**:
   - Admin authentication flow
   - Gallery CRUD operations
   - Product management operations
   - Payment status toggling

5. **Agent Context Updated** → `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Comprehensive development guide created
   - Technology stack documented
   - Architecture patterns explained
   - Deployment procedures outlined

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, implemented functionality, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Tasks were executed during development*

**Task Generation Strategy Applied**:
- Authentication system setup and testing
- Admin dashboard UI implementation
- Gallery management CRUD operations
- Product management CRUD operations
- API endpoint implementation with validation
- Frontend component development
- Environment configuration and deployment

**Ordering Strategy Used**:
- Foundation: Next.js setup, TypeScript configuration
- Authentication: NextAuth.js integration, OAuth setup
- Backend: API routes, data models, validation
- Frontend: React components, UI implementation
- Integration: End-to-end testing, deployment

**Actual Implementation**: All tasks completed successfully and deployed to production

## Phase 3+: Implementation Status
*All phases completed successfully*

**Phase 3**: ✅ COMPLETE - All functionality implemented and tested
**Phase 4**: ✅ COMPLETE - Production deployment on Cloudflare Pages operational
**Phase 5**: ✅ COMPLETE - Manual testing validated, all acceptance criteria met

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

| Implementation Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| JSON file persistence | Cloudflare Pages simplicity | Database complexity for single admin |
| NextAuth.js dependency | OAuth security complexity | Custom implementation risk |
| Tailwind CSS framework | Design system consistency | Custom CSS maintenance overhead |
