# ‚úÖ Full TODO List (Prioritized as of 9:30am PST 06/01/2025)

**Last Updated:** 2024-06-02T17:03:07Z
lastUpdated: 2025-06-01T10:28:29-0700
**Instructions:**

* Complete each task in order of priority. After each, scan the entire project (every file, byte, and feature) to ensure it works as intended. Only mark as done if fully verified. If a task cannot be completed due to errors or missing input, skip it and return later unless it is necessary to move the project forward.
* If you want to bypass this list and have me execute the following tasks in "Just work mode," you must:

  1. Explicitly say "Just work mode engage."
  2. Provide the task number(s) or section to begin.
  3. Allow me to auto-execute tasks in sequence without waiting for per-task confirmation unless a step requires input.
  4. I will log all actions performed and flag anything skipped, failed, or requiring input.

**To enable body-cast Just Work Mode view and execute all following tasks automatically:**

1. Say "Just work mode engage in body-cast mode."
2. I will begin with the first unchecked High Priority item in the list and continue sequentially.
3. If any task requires input or fails, I will log the issue, skip the task, and continue. No confirmation will be requested unless essential.
4. I will return an audit log of actions taken, errors found, and skipped items after completing the run.

* **Integrate Firebase:** Utilize Firebase for data storage, authentication, image uploads, and any other applicable features.
* **Hosting:** The site will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
* **Domain:** The website domain is wretcheddesigns.com.
* **Skipped Tasks:** If a task cannot be completed, skip it, note it here, and bring it to attention when all possible tasks are done.
* **Auto-update Timestamp:** Use CI or a pre-commit Git hook to inject the actual timestamp where `{{AUTO_TIMESTAMP}}` appears. The hook must parse this file and replace `{{AUTO_TIMESTAMP}}` with the current date and time on every commit.
